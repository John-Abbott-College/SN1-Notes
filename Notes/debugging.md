# Debugging 



### [Advanced Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0Wz_uBaDmo)



Here a few words we will be using a lot when programming....

**Bugs**

A software bug is a mistake in code that is causing unexpected behavior. For example a calculation error, or an error in the logic of a program. Think of the peanut butter sandwich making exercise. Imprecise or incorrect instructions lead to errors and unexpected behavior!

**Debugging**

Debugging is the process or running your code step by step in order to find and fix bugs. It's this frustrating part of coding when you are first starting but it gets better as you practice solving your own mistakes. 

**Debugger**

Is a software tool that allows pausing of the execution of code, inspecting variables, stepping through the lines of code in order to fix bugs.

**Breakpoints:**

Breakpoints are red markers added on the left margin to tell the Python Debugger to suspend the execution of the program at that very specific line of code. 

**PyCharm debug mode**

PyCharm is an amazing Python IDE as it allows us to write code, run it and debug it all in the same interface. Add a breakpoint by clicking on the left margin of a line of code and then by clicking the debug button (looks like a green bug):
