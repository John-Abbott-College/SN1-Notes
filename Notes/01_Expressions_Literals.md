# Literals

**Literals:** Are simple the simplest forms of expressions, they are simply raw values contained within your source code and that are vital for the program to run well. A literal can be a simple number, or a string. Let's look at a few examples of literals you will be using all the time.

**Example 1** - A simple number entered into Python, will be evaluated and understood as a numeric literal. This literal is of type integer or *int* as it doesn't have any fractional part. 

```
314
```

**Example 2** - A decimal number is also a numeric literal, but of a different type. It is of type *float* because it has a fractional part:

```
21.0
```

**Example 3** - A string of characters is a literal of type *string*

```python
"Hello World"
```
