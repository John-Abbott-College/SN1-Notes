# Python Installation

## How to download, install, and configure Python

By default, Python is usually not installed on Windows. However, you can check if it exists on the system by running one line of command on the command prompt: `python --version`

To download Python, you need to visit https://www.python.org/downloads/, which is the official Python website.

Click on the Downloads tab and then select the option for your operating system. This should start downloading the installer.



Once the installer opens, make sure to select the options "Use admin privileges" and "Add python.exe to PATH". Then click on "Install Now"
