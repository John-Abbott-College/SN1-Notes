# Python expressions

Lines of code are made up of **statements** and **expressions**. Statements will be seen a little bit further in the future but they typically allow us to add decision making and logic into our program. On the other hand, **expressions** are a combination of literals, variables, operators and functions. 

- **Literals** are simple raw data such as numbers or strings of characters
- **Variables** are stored values in memory that can be modified
- **Operators** are simply mathematic operators that help perform certain operations on the data
- **Function** are similar to mathematical functions which perform more complex tasks

We will discuss each of those in more details in this section.
