# Create your first project

To create a new project in PyCharm for Python, follow these steps:

**Open PyCharm**: Launch PyCharm from your start menu, desktop shortcut, or application launcher.



### **Start a New Project**:

- If you see the **Welcome to PyCharm** dialog, click on "New Project".
- If you already have PyCharm open, go to the top menu and select **File > New Project**.

### **Configure the New Project**:

- **Location**: Specify the directory where you want to create the project. You can type the path directly or click the folder icon to navigate to the desired location.

- **Python Interpreter**: Choose the Python interpreter you want to use for the project. You can use an existing interpreter or create a new virtual environment. To create a new virtual environment, select **New environment using** and choose `Virtualenv` (recommended).

- **More Settings (Optional)**:

  - **Base Interpreter**: If you are creating a new virtual environment, you need to select the base interpreter. This is usually the Python executable you installed on your system.

### Explanation:

- **print**: This is a built-in Python function used to display text or other output to the console.
- **"Hello, World!"**: This is a string (a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes) that you want to print. In Python, you can use either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`) to define a string.
