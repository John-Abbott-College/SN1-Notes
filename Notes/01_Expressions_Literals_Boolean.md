# Booleans

Python has several numeric types (`int`, `float`and `complex`) but only one logical type: the boolean type or `bool`.  A boolean value can only have two values, either `True` or `False`. 

This type becomes very useful when making yes-no type of decisions in the program. For example: 

- If my age is greater or equal than 18, then print "You can vote"
- If my age is lower than 18, then print "Sorry, you can't vote yet."



### Conversion into numeric types

Booleans can be converted into numeric types. `True` is equivalent to 1 and `False` is equivalent to 0.

- To convert a `bool` into an integer or a float, you can also use the `int(True)` or `float(True)` constructors. 

- To convert any other type into a `bool`, you can use the `bool()` function, e.g. `bool(0)` is `False`  and `bool(1)` is `True`

  - Note: That converting any number other than zero will be `True`, e.g. `bool(1234)` is `True`

  



We will learn more about booleans in conditional statements (i.e. `if/else` statements)

Boolean logic and conditional statements, can help us create interesting algorithms!

Doctors too can have their own boolean logic it seems...
