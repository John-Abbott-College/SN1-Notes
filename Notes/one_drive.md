# One Drive 

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of setting up One Drive and using it to run your PyCharm projects. Configuring one drive saves your files into the Cloud and therefore allows you to alternate through multiple computers in school and at home without losing your files. 

## Mac (Optional)

If you are bringing your laptop with you to school, then this tutorial might not be so useful because you do not have the need to work on the lab computers. Nevertheless, here is a tutorial video on how to setup One Drive on your Mac.



## Windows

One Drive is installed by default on all Windows computers. 

1. Use the search bar to search for the ***One Drive*** App:

2. Login to the app using your John Abott credentials :

   - Email: <student_id>.johnabbottcollege.net
   - Password: Same as the one you use in the labs

3. Complete the steps of verification using your phone or personal email.

4. Click **Next** , your One Drive folder will be saved in: *C: > Users > student _id > OneDrive - John Abbott College*

5. Wait until the scanning of the files is complete.

6. Click **Start backup**

   <img src="../Images/onedrive_7.png" height=350 class=inline-img/>

This might take a few minutes to complete....

7. Once the backup is complete, navigate to the **File Explorer**

8. You should see the *OneDrive - John Abbott College* folder appear as a file directory:

   <img src="../Images/onedrive_9.png" height=350 class=inline-img/>

9. All synchronized files have three types of icon: **Online-only, On this device and Always available**

10. As you navigate inside the OneDrive John Abbott College, you should see these icons appear in the File Explorer:

    <img src="../Images/onedrive_11.png" height=350 class=inline-img/>

11. We highly suggest you keep this One Drive organized as you will be using it throughout your college studies. 

12. Create a folder named ***SN1***. Moving forward this is where you should put your labs and assignments.

13. We highly recommend you keep your Labs and Assignments organized in separate folders. This will help you find them if you need to re-use them in the future.

    > **Example of folder structure:**
    >
    > 
    >
    > OneDrive John Abbott College >
    >
    > - Semester 1
    >   - SN1
    >     - Lab0:
    >       - outline_game.py
    >       - introductions.py
    >     - Lab1 
    >       - lab1.py
    >       - output.txt
    >     - Lab2
    >       - lab2.py
    >     - Assignment1
    >       - exercise1_a.py
    >       - exercise2_a.py
    >       - exercise2.py

14. We discourage you from keeping your projects into the default locations such as the *Downloads* folder, *PycharmProjects* folder or other dark locations of the computer.
