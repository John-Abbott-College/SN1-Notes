6. Click on the desired assignment and a popup window will show you the details of the assignment. At the top in the red box you will see any instructions for the assignment you can download to view, and boxed in red at the bottom will be a submission box.

7. If you’ve noticed you may have made a mistake, or if your professor asks you for a resubmission, or you have some other reason to update your work, that’s okay! Provided you’ve let your professor know, the process of updating is the same as outlined above, with a slightly different description:

Once you resubmit, here’s what the assignments should look like. Highlighted, in yellow, is your most recent submission to an assignment, followed by the one previous, and so on. On the right, I circled the corresponding assignment to show the checks will appear for every submission you add based on if they were on time for the assignment’s deadline or not.
