# One Drive 

This tutorial will walk you through the steps of setting up One Drive and using it to run your PyCharm projects. By configuring OneDrive, your files will be saved to the cloud, enabling you to seamlessly switch between multiple computers at school and home without losing your work.

## Mac (Optional)

If you are bringing your laptop with you to school, then this tutorial might not be so useful because you do not have the need to work on the lab computers. Nevertheless, here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhcJxKOete4&ab_channel=AldoJames) video on how to setup One Drive on your Mac.



## Windows

One Drive is installed by default on all Windows computers. 

1. Use the search bar to search for the ***One Drive*** App:

2. Login to the app using your John Abott credentials :

   - Email: student_id.johnabbottcollege.net
   - Password: Same as the one you use in the labs

3. Complete the steps of verification using your phone or personal email.

4. Click **Next** , your One Drive folder will be saved in: *C: > Users > student _id > OneDrive - John Abbott College*

5. Wait until the scanning of the files is complete.

6. Click **Start backup**

This might take a few minutes to complete....

7. Once the backup is complete, navigate to the **File Explorer**

8. You should see the *OneDrive - John Abbott College* folder appear as a file directory:

   <img src="Images/onedrive_9.png" height=350 class=inline-img/>

9. All synchronized files have three types of icon: **Online-only, On this device and Always available**

10. As you navigate inside the OneDrive John Abbott College, you should see these icons appear in the File Explorer:

    <img src="Images/onedrive_11.png" height=250 class=inline-img/>

    

11. We highly suggest you keep this One Drive organized as you will be using it throughout your college studies. 

12. Create a folder named ***SN1***. Moving forward this is where you should put your labs and assignments.

13. We highly recommend you keep your Labs and Assignments organized in separate folders. This will help you find them if you need to re-use them in the future.

    > **Example of folder structure:**
    >
    > 
    >
    > OneDrive John Abbott College >
    >
    > - Semester 1
    >   - SN1
    >     - Lab0:
    >       - outline_game.py
    >       - introductions.py
    >     - Lab1 
    >       - lab1.py
    >       - output.txt
    >     - Lab2
    >       - lab2.py
    >     - Assignment1
    >       - exercise1_a.py
    >       - exercise2_a.py
    >       - exercise2.py

14. We discourage you from keeping your projects into the default locations such as the *Downloads* folder, *PycharmProjects* folder or other obscure areas of your computer ü¶á üï∑Ô∏è



## How to start a Lab or Assignment from OneDrive?

This other tutorial will walk you through the recommended steps for starting an assignment or Lab while using OneDrive to keep your files synchronized.

1. Download the instructions from L√©a. 

<img src="Images/onedrive_14.png" height=200 class=inline-img/>

2. Find the downloaded instructions. The default location is the *Downloads* folder. 

3. Extract the instructions if they are zipped (right click > extract all...)

   <img src="Images/onedrive_15.png" height=300 class=inline-img/>

4. You might be tempted to open it right away and start coding. **WAIT**! Let's move it out of the Downloads and into our OneDrive  folder to keep it safe and synchronized.

5. Drag the entire instructions into your *SN1*  folder within OneDrive

   <img src="Images/onedrive_16.png" height=300 class=inline-img/>

We are almost ready to start coding!

6. We just need to open this in PyCharm!

7. Open PyCharm:

   <img src="Images/onedrive_17.png" height=300 class=inline-img/>

   You could start a Project then save the project in this created folder, but this might take you more time. 

8. Instead, click on **Open**

9. Open the location of your **SN1** labs/ assignments in PyCharm:

   <img src="Images/onedrive_18.png" height=350 class=inline-img/>

10. PyCharm might ask you:  ***Trust and Open Project `SN1` ?***

11. Check the box  *Trust projects in ...OneDrive - John Abbott College*, this way you do not need to do it again.

12. Click **Trust Project**

    <img src="Images/onedrive_19.png" height=150 class=inline-img/>

13. We are almost here! You can see your Lab.py in the **Project Explorer**:

    <img src="Images/onedrive_20.png" height=400 class=inline-img/>

14. There is one small problem, because we Opened an existing project instead of creating one, PyCharm is a little bit confused which project settings to use (notice the warning sign at the top).

    <img src="Images/onedrive_20.5.png" height=250 class=inline-img/>

15. Click on the **gear icon** 

16. Click Add **New Interpreter**  > **Add Local Interpreter** 

    <img src="Images/onedrive_21.png" height=200 class=inline-img/>

    

17. On the school computers, choose **System Interpreter** > **OK**

    <img src="Images/onedrive_22.png" height=500 class=inline-img/>



This might take a few seconds to index the file.... 



18. You should be able to start the lab and safely synchronize your files between computers. **DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE (CTRL + S) AS YOU PROGRESS** 

19. Yeeyy! Our file is synchronized everywhere!
